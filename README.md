# E-commerce

This is an e-commerce that i have created with Next and deployed with Vercel. I had a lot of joy doing this project. I really enjoy doing React appications becouse i love it's logic and the way components comunicate with each other. Building a shopping cart is`t easy but once you undestand the logic it's construction becomes really fun.
